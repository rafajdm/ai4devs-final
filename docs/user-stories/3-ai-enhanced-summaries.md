# 3. AI-Enhanced Summaries

## User Story

“As a user, I want AI to store any extracted info in `ai_summary` (and update columns like `days_of_week`) so all relevant details appear in one place.”

## Acceptance Criteria

- The AI step populates any unparsed fields (instead of a simple text summary).
- Updated data is visible in the frontend once `/ai-process` completes.

## Estimation

- **Story Points**: 5
- **Hours (approx.)**: 6–8

### Additional Notes

- These estimates assume one developer working through all tasks.
- Acceptance Criteria can be refined further if edge cases arise (e.g., handling partial data, network timeouts, etc.).
- The Story Points are illustrative; your team might use a different scale or approach to sizing.
