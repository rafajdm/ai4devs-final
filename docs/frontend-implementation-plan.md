# Frontend Implementation Plan

Below is an implementation plan that outlines the steps to update and build your frontend MVP. This plan takes into account updating dependencies to the latest stable versions and creating the new components and page structure.

---

## 1. Environment and Dependency Updates

- **Review and Update Dependencies:**
  - Check that you’re using the latest stable versions of React, ReactDOM, Vite, TailwindCSS, and any related tooling.
  - Update your `package.json` if necessary (or run the appropriate npm commands) so that your dependencies reflect the latest stable releases. For example, if React 19 is the current version and it’s working for your project, verify that it’s correctly installed.
- **Install Additional Dependencies (if needed):**
  - Consider if you need a carousel library (like react-slick or similar) or if you’ll build a custom one.
  - Confirm that your ESLint, PostCSS, and autoprefixer configurations are up-to-date.

## 2. File Structure Planning

Based on your MVP design, you’ll be adding new components and a new page. Your updated folder structure under `/frontend/src/` will look like this:

```
/frontend/src/
   ├── components/
   │      ├── MenuToolbar.jsx         // The top navigation bar with logo and sub-menu
   │      ├── SearchFilters.jsx       // Full-width bar for search/filter placeholder
   │      ├── PromotionsCarousel.jsx  // Carousel component for promotion cards
   │      └── PromotionCard.jsx       // Individual promotion card component
   ├── pages/
   │      └── Home.jsx                // Main page that assembles the above components
   ├── App.jsx                        // Updated to include routing/display the Home page
   ├── App.css                        // Component-specific/global styles for App
   ├── index.css                      // Global CSS resets and base styles
   └── main.jsx                       // Entry point (unchanged, if already configured)
```

## 3. Component Development

- **Menu Toolbar Component (`MenuToolbar.jsx`):**
  - Create a horizontal bar at the top of the screen.
  - No extra sections (e.g., About Us, Contact, etc.) are needed for the MVP.
  - Display the MVP name in text with a clean, modern font (no logo).
- **Search Filters Component (`SearchFilters.jsx`):**
  - Create a full-width bar immediately below the menu.
  - This area serves as a placeholder for future search filter functionality.
- **Promotions Carousel Component (`PromotionsCarousel.jsx`):**
  - Build a carousel that displays promotion cards horizontally.
  - On larger screens, display multiple cards side-by-side; on mobile, show one card at a time.
  - Implement left/right scrolling (or swipe gestures on mobile) for navigation.
  - Include preloading for the initial set of cards and lazy loading for additional cards as the user navigates.
- **Promotion Card Component (`PromotionCard.jsx`):**
  - Define a card layout that shows key promotion details (for example, restaurant name, discount, and valid period).
  - This component will be used by the Promotions Carousel.
- **Footer (`Footer.jsx`):**
  - Add a footer section with basic text: “Desarrollado por Rafael Diaz para el final de AI4Devs”.

## 4. Page Assembly and Routing

- **Home Page (`Home.jsx`):**
  - Assemble the newly created components in the desired order:
    1. MenuToolbar at the top.
    2. SearchFilters immediately below.
    3. PromotionsCarousel as the main content section.
  - This page becomes your default view.
- **App Integration (`App.jsx`):**
  - Update the `App.jsx` to include routing (if needed) or simply render the Home page.
  - Ensure that your main layout accommodates the new sections.

---

## 5. Styling and Responsiveness

- **Global Styles (`index.css`):**
  - Ensure you have your CSS reset and base styles.
  - Define any global typography, color schemes, or spacing that your MVP design requires.
- **Component-Specific Styles (`App.css` and/or component-level styles):**
  - Use TailwindCSS (or standard CSS) to style the new components.
  - Focus on responsive design to support desktop and mobile views (e.g., using Tailwind’s responsive classes).

---

## 6. Testing and Iteration

- **Development Testing:**
  - Run `npm run dev` to start your Vite development server.
  - Test the layout and responsiveness in various browsers and on mobile devices.
  - Validate the carousel behavior (scrolling, lazy loading) and menu functionality.
- **Debug and Iterate:**
  - Adjust styles and component behavior based on your testing feedback.
  - Make sure the integration between components is smooth and that the overall user experience meets the MVP requirements.

---

## 7. Final Review and Next Steps

- **Final Code Review:**
  - Once all components are in place, perform a thorough review of your code and layout.
  - Check for consistency in design and responsiveness.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Integrate real data for promotions.
  - Enhance the search filter functionality.
  - Consider additional modules as your MVP expands.
