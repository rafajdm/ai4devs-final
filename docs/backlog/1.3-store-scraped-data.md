# Ticket 1.3: Store Scraped Data in PostgreSQL

## Description

- Insert the extracted promotions into the `promotions` table (using psycopg2).
- Ensure the final stored columns include `days_of_week` and `ai_summary`.
- Avoid duplicates by checking existing records (where feasible).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Each run of the scraper populates fields such as `restaurant_name`, `discount_rate`, `days_of_week`, and `ai_summary`.
2. Data includes required fields (name, discount, valid dates, etc.).
3. No DB constraints are violated.

## Dependencies

- Ticket 1.2 (scraping logic complete), valid DB connection set up.

## Estimate

- 3â€“4 hours
